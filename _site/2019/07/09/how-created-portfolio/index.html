It provided a way to make websites out of any repository without getting help from website builders like Wordpress and Wix. I always felt these website builders are not really part of me, so I decided to create my own customized blog. So here I am, writing in this brand new blog.</p><p><img src="/in-post-images/Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 16.00.06.png" alt="" /></p><p>To briefly explain, this blog will be a one-stop website where I document any new Data Science skills, personal projects, and simply my thoughts as well. Through this, I want to keep track of what I do, so that I will be able to roughly estimate what I did in certain point in time.</p><p>Whenever we try to gain new skills, there is always a learning curve and a point in time where we say, “Aha, now I can comfortably search on Google to dig ‘deeper’”. To learn how to make a <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> website and customize it, which is an engine that powers GitHub pages, I had to go through a quite steep learning curve. On GitHub Pages official website, it says it will take only minutes to get it up and running. It was true, but I wanted to go further than just using one of the themes already built in.</p><p>And I am sure many of those who want a website are also like me.</p><p>I started by exploring <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/">Jekyll themes</a>. Among hundreds of themes, I chose <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/trophy/">Trophy theme</a> which looked simply and elegant. Now, I faced a problem: How on earth should I go about using this theme?</p><p><img src="/in-post-images/Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 16.04.30.png" alt="" /></p><p>GitHub pages documentation didn’t help much. Instructions on Jekyll official website were too new to me and confusing. What I learned is that I can create one website using my GitHub username and set it as a blog. Building websites for projects is another topic. I created new repository and named it <code class="highlighter-rouge">sangwookcheon.github.io</code>. The name has to be formatted as <code class="highlighter-rouge">username.github.io</code> so that GitHub will automatically detect it.</p><p>First I decided to look at video tutorials for creating Jekyll websites. I watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T1itpPvFWHI&amp;list=PLLAZ4kZ9dFpOPV5C5Ay0pHaa0RJFhcmcB">four tutorials</a>, and stopped right there. I went to Trophy theme’s GitHub repository, downloaded all the files from the Master branch, and pasted them all into my Atom editor. I also configured version control.</p><p>From those four tutorials, I installed necessary packages and learned how to create a blank website. I also learned important commands.</p><ul><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code> builds the website and stores static content in <code class="highlighter-rouge">_site</code> folder, and produces a link containing a preview of the website.</li><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code> only builds the website and store information in the folder.</li></ul><p>Now that I can work on Atom and just push commits to GitHub, I decided to play around with the files. Because the files are supposed to create a site just like this <a href="https://thomasvaeth.github.io/trophy-jekyll/">demo website</a>, I compared it with code side by side to figure out what different components. Here are things I discovered:</p><ul><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> folder is where I put all the blog posts. The posts are Markdown files, and each contains YAML Front Matter, where I type Title, Date, Category, and more. This is just like making a new post on Wordpress of Medium.</li><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">_sass</code> folder contains all the visual components like font style and background color. This folder might not be in some of the themes, but the styles are always stored in <code class="highlighter-rouge">.scss</code> files.</li><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> is where I can define many things: Email, social links, defualt image, etc. Things I can customize differ theme by theme.</li><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">Gemfile</code> contains important plugins for the website. One important plugin for GitHub pages is <code class="highlighter-rouge">gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins</code>, which allows us to see if the website will properly run in GitHub pages.</li><li><code class="highlighter-rouge">_includes</code> folder and <code class="highlighter-rouge">_layouts</code> kind of go hand-in-hand, and they contain main contents of the website. The files can be customized to change how things are displayed, such as buttons, images, etc.</li></ul><p>In fact, I discovered that GitHub pages restricts what plugins can be rendered. Here’s a <a href="https://pages.github.com/versions/">website</a> that shows all whitelisted plugins.</p><p>This theme had a plugin called <code class="highlighter-rouge">octopress-autoprefixer</code> which is not allowed in GitHub pages, so I simply got rid of it. Fortunately, nothing changed visually in the website. It is important to first check whether the website can be deployed on GitHub pages before customizing things.</p><p>So this is the base I created for myself. Now that the website properly runs on GitHub with the link ‘https://sangwookcheon.github.io’, I decided to play around with files. I added ‘About Me’ and ‘Projects’ tab, changed font and color scheme, added Particles.js, and much more. I published all of this on <a href="https://github.com/SangwookCheon/sangwookcheon.github.io">GitHub</a>.</p><p><img src="/in-post-images/Screen Shot 2019-07-11 at 16.34.00.png" alt="" /> Here you can play around with the animation. Refer to its GitHub repository to install it on your own website.</p><p>I have to be clear: I was 2% familiar with CSS and Javascript, and maybe 20% proficient in HTML. But I didn’t hesitate changing the website because I had my ‘secret’ weapon: Google. One of the sites I visited most is undoubtedly Stack Overflow.</p><p>I encountered a lot of unexpected problems due to my lack of experience in web development, and I wrote down major ones on my <a href="https://github.com/SangwookCheon/sangwookcheon.github.io">GitHub repository</a>.</p><p>Building Jekyll website was one of the things I had to struggle with to be proficient. I had to have certain level of knowledge to confidently and safely tinker with code located deep down in the file tree. And I think getting this foundation is the hardest, or the most boring process.</p><p>Data Science should be no different, as I must be able to clean and process any kind of data so that I can develop models. Looking ahead, imagining myself standing over the uphill, now I am going to go ahead and set the foundation.</p><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script> var disqus_config = function () { this.page.url = "http://localhost:4000/2019/07/09/how-created-portfolio/"; this.page.identifier = "/2019/07/09/how-created-portfolio"; }; (function() { var d = document, s = d.createElement('script'); s.src = 'https://sangwookcheon.disqus.com/embed.js'; s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date()); (d.head || d.body).appendChild(s); })(); </script> <noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript></div></section><section class="profile"><div class="profile__card"><div class="profile__img"><figure class="absolute-bg" style="background-image: url('/images/SangwookCpic.png');"></figure></div><div class="profile__container"><p>My name is Sangwook Cheon, a high school student at Jakarta Intercultural School.
